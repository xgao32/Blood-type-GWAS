This folder contains tables in `tsv` format to map blood type to genes to chromosome number to genetic variant in HGVS nomenclature to actual genomic coordinates in GRCh37 and GRCh38.

## Folders
The folder `erythrogene_tables` contains the 3 supplementary files from the publication associated with the Erythrogene database. 

The folder `ISBTdb` contains `tsv` files relating blood types for a particular blood group system to allele name to genetic variants in HGVS nomenclature. This folder was copied from alicloud server directory `root/standard/ISBTdb`

## Files
The `gene_chromosome_table.tsv` file relates gene to the chromosome that it is located on. This file was generated by prompting chatgpt for a list of genes related to blood group systems and their location on the chromosomes and then manually correcting the chromosome number.
